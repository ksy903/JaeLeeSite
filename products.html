        The Serpentine Triple Pass heaters are modular field replaceable products. The heater unit consists of a Serpentine-coil electric heater element that fi ts into a stainless steel “triple-pass”exchanger housing and makes electrical connections through fittings pressed into the base. The housing uses the incoming air to cool the outer shell prior to passing through the heater element. This minimizes radiant heat loss and provides a safe to the touch product to minimize injury to operators who come in contact with the heater.
